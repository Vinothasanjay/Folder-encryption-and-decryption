To create a README file for your Python script on GitHub, you can provide an overview of what the script does, how to set it up, and any dependencies required. Here's a basic template you can use:

# Folder Encryption Software

This is a Python application for encrypting, decrypting, and hiding folders using various cryptographic techniques and file manipulation methods.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts files within a selected folder using AES encryption.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts previously encrypted files within a folder using the provided encryption key.
- **Folder Hiding**: Hides and unhides folders by altering file attributes.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pycryptodomex`
- `pillow`
- `cryptography`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pycryptodomex pillow cryptography
```

## Usage

1. **Encrypt Folder**:
   - Run the script and click on "ENCRYPT FOLDER".
   - Select a folder to encrypt and enter sender/receiver emails and SMTP password.
   - Files within the folder will be encrypted using AES encryption.

2. **Decrypt Folder**:
   - Click on "DECRYPT FOLDER".
   - Select the previously encrypted folder and enter the decryption password.
   - Encrypted files will be decrypted back to their original state.

3. **Hide/Unhide Folder**:
   - Click on "HIDE FOLDER" to hide a selected folder by altering its attributes.
   - Use "UNHIDE FOLDER" to reverse the process and make the folder visible again.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if not installed):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python folder_encryption.py
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure you have valid SMTP credentials to send emails with the encryption key.
- Use this software responsibly and only on folders/files you have permission to modify.

Replace `your-username` and `your-repository` in the GitHub clone URL with your actual GitHub username and repository name. Modify the instructions and details according to your specific implementation and requirements. This README provides a structured overview to help users understand and utilize your folder encryption software effectively.
